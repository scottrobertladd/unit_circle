For me, understanding something requires a practical application.
I've never been good at abstract learning, at least when it comes
to hands-on tasks like computer programming.

I've been exploring the Cairo enhancements to GTK+, and wrote a
small program to see how it all worked. In the case of Cairo, the
Unit Circle program stems from teaching my daughters some aspects
of trigonometry. The program isn't rocket science, but it did
give me ample opportunity to fiddle with an interactive graphics
program.

The unit circle (where the radius equals 1) provides a very clear
demonstration of how various trigonometric functions relate to
angles and one another. Draw an angle line from the origin to
a point on the circumphrence of the circle; the (x,y) coordinates
of that point will will be the cosine and since of the angle.

In Unit Circle, use the mouse to set the angle line by either
clicking or dragging the pointer inside the diagram. Change the
trigonmetric values in the fields, and the angle will
automatically adjust.
